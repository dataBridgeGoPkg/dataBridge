Once this material is obtained, the scammer threatens to share it with the victim's contacts, family, or publicly online unless their demands are met. In some cases, scammers may claim to have hacked the victim's devices and obtained such material without their direct consent. Sophisticated sextortion schemes can involve creating fake social media profiles of the victim's friends or family to make the threat of exposure more real. Even after a victim pays, there is no guarantee the material will not be shared, and the demands often continue.

The increasing reliance on digital infrastructure makes individuals and businesses more vulnerable to these forms of extortion. Sophisticated threat actors often employ advanced encryption techniques and operate from jurisdictions where legal action is difficult, making recovery of data or prosecution of the perpetrators challenging. The potential financial and reputational damage of data loss or service disruption often compels victims to consider paying the ransom, despite law enforcement recommendations against it."
