General structure reminder:

https://your-domain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/search?jql={URL_ENCODED_JQL_QUERY}

Where {URL_ENCODED_JQL_QUERY} is:
project%3DRUNN%20AND%20status%20in%20(%22StatusName%22)
or
project%3DRUNN%20AND%20status%20in%20(%22StatusName%22)%20AND%20statusCategoryChangedDate%20%3E%3D%20%22-2w%22

Remember that  (space) becomes %20 and " (double quote) becomes %22 in URL encoding for JQL strings. Special characters like Ã© also need to be properly encoded (e.g., %C3%A9).

These URLs should allow you to programmatically fetch the data you need for each of those filters!
